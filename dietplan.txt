Now that we have your age (32 years), let's calculate your calorie needs.

Step 1: Calculate BMR
Using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation for females:

𝐵
𝑀
𝑅
=
(
10
×
71
)
+
(
6.25
×
154
)
−
(
5
×
32
)
−
161
BMR=(10×71)+(6.25×154)−(5×32)−161
𝐵
𝑀
𝑅
=
710
+
962.5
−
160
−
161
BMR=710+962.5−160−161
𝐵
𝑀
𝑅
=
1351.5
≈
1352
 kcal/day
BMR=1351.5≈1352 kcal/day
Step 2: Calculate TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
Since you are moderately active (3-5 days of exercise per week), we multiply your BMR by 1.55:

𝑇
𝐷
𝐸
𝐸
=
1352
×
1.55
TDEE=1352×1.55
𝑇
𝐷
𝐸
𝐸
=
2094
 kcal/day
TDEE=2094 kcal/day
This means you maintain your weight at ~2094 kcal/day.

Step 3: Calculate Calorie Intake for Weight Loss
To lose weight, you need a calorie deficit:

Mild weight loss (0.25 kg per week): ~ 1600-1700 kcal/day
Moderate weight loss (0.5 kg per week): ~ 1400-1500 kcal/day
Final Recommendation:
👉 To lose 0.5 kg per week, aim for 1400-1500 kcal/day.
👉 To lose 0.25 kg per week, aim for 1600-1700 kcal/day.

Selenium-rich foods: Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, eggs, fish
Zinc-rich foods: Chickpeas, nuts, whole grains
Protein sources: Chicken, fish, paneer, tofu, eggs, lentils
Complex carbs & fiber: Whole grains, vegetables, legumes
🚫 Foods to Limit
Goitrogenic foods (if eaten raw in excess): Cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, soy
Highly processed foods & sugar: Can slow metabolism
Excess gluten (if sensitive): May affect thyroid function in some cases

 Customized Meal Plan for Weight Loss of 3kg & Thyroid Health
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
🚨 Important Note: Losing 3 kg per week is extremely aggressive and may not be safe!
A safe and sustainable weight loss rate is 0.5-1 kg per week. Losing 3 kg per week would require a very large calorie deficit (~1500-1800 kcal/day), which can lead to muscle loss, nutrient deficiencies, and hormonal imbalances—especially with thyroid issues.

Would you like to aim for a more sustainable 1-1.5 kg per week instead? I can still provide a low-calorie (~900-1000 kcal/day) meal plan, but it’s important to do it in a way that doesn’t harm your health. Let me know how you'd like to proceed! 😊
